## SVI Score and Themes by State in US
### Project Goals:
•	Identify High Vulnerability States: Pinpoint states with high average SVI scores, helping to target areas with potentially greater social vulnerability.

•	Theme Analysis for Targeted Interventions: Assess which SVI themes contribute the most to the average score in each state, enabling targeted interventions (e.g., housing support in states with high vulnerability from Housing & Transportation).

### Project Outcomes:
•	State-Level SVI Heatmap: A visual heatmap of the U.S. showing average SVI scores by state, allowing stakeholders to easily interpret and locate areas of high vulnerability.

•	Theme Distribution Insights: Bar charts or radar plots for each state showing the relative contribution of each of the four themes to the average SVI score, highlighting which themes drive the vulnerability score the most.

•	Identification of Theme-Driven Hotspots: Insights into which themes are consistently high across states with the highest average SVI scores, potentially indicating broader systemic issues
